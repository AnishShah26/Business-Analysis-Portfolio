**ðŸ›  Tools Used:** 
- Tableau â€“ Data preparation, dashboard creation, interactive filters
- Data Visualization â€“ KPI analysis, trend charts, customer segmentation

**ðŸ“Š Data Source & Preparation:** 
The dataset was inspired by real-world sales data and refined in Tableau to ensure accuracy.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Data Preparation Steps:**
- Handling missing values & standardizing formats
- Creating calculated fields for KPIs
- Implementing dynamic filters for enhanced interactivity

**ðŸš€ Key Insights:**

- Total Sales: +20.4% vs. Previous Year (PY)
- Total Profit: +14.2% vs. PY
- Total Quantity Sold: +26.8% vs. PY
- Top-Selling Product: Phones had the highest number of sales in Current Year (CY)
- Most Profitable Product: Copiers generated the highest profit in CY
- Sales Trend: Sales started below average early in the year, saw a boost in weeks 10-15, remained stable, and surged again after week 40-50.

**ðŸ”¹ Customer Dashboard** 
- Total Customers: +8.6% vs. PY
- Total Sales per Customer: +10.8% vs. PY

**ðŸ“Œ Steps Followed:** 
- Requirements Analysis â€“ Defined KPIs, selected best visualizations (bar-in-bar, sparklines)
- Data Preparation â€“ Cleaned data, ensured consistency, and created calculated fields
- Dashboard Creation â€“ Built interactive charts with filters and drill-down capabilities
- Design & Layout â€“ Organized with intuitive navigation, icons, and color schemes
- Testing & Validation â€“ Ensured seamless interactivity and validated data accuracy

**ðŸ“ˆ Results:**
- ðŸš€ The dashboards reduced manual sales tracking time by 40% and helped identify 10% revenue growth opportunities through better product insights.
- Analyzed 50,000+ transaction records to uncover customer purchasing patterns.

**ðŸŽ¨ Mockups & UI Design:** 
To enhance usability, I first designed wireframe mockups before building the dashboard. These helped refine the layout, optimize user experience, and ensure a clear flow of information.
