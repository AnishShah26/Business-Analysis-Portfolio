**Goal:**  
To provide stakeholders with insights into sales performance and customer behavior.

**Description:**  
This project focused on creating two interactive dashboards in Tableau

**Sales Dashboard:**  
Presents KPIs like total sales, profits, and quantity, comparing data across years with monthly and weekly trends.

**Customer Dashboard:**  
Analyzes customer behavior, top customers by profit, and provides insights on customer distribution based on the number of orders.

**Skills:**  
Data visualization, dashboard creation, interactive filters, KPI analysis, user-driven insights.

**Technology:**  
Tableau

**Steps Followed:**

1. Requirements Analysis: Defined KPIs, selected appropriate charts (e.g., bar-in-bar for product comparison, sparkline for trends), and created wireframe mockups.

2. Data Preparation: Connected and cleaned data, ensuring consistency and handling missing values.

3. Dashboard Creation: Developed calculated fields for KPIs, built interactive charts, and implemented dynamic filters for user exploration.

4. Design & Layout: Organized dashboards with intuitive containers, icons, and color schemes for easy navigation.

5. Testing & Validation: Ensured interactivity (filtering, drilling down) worked seamlessly, and validated data accuracy across both dashboards.

**Results:**  
The dashboards provide dynamic, interactive views that allow users to analyze sales performance over time, compare product subcategory performance, and explore customer behaviors to improve business decisions.
